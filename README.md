ioctl
================

`import "acln.ro/ioctl"`

Package ioctl provides facilities to define ioctl numbers and perform ioctls
against file descriptors.

See the documentation at https://godoc.org/acln.ro/ioctl.

Note: this package is very young and probably doesn't work on any operating
system besides Linux, and on any architecture besides amd64 or 386.
